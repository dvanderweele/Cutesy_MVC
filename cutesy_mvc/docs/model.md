# Models 

## The `Model` class 

User-defined models should extend the `Model` class, which provides a lot of convenient functionality â€” most of which is built on top of the query builder. 

One of the most obvious factors in your successful usage of the model system is ensuring that your models and migrations correspond to one another coherently. For instance, if your model is expecting timestamp columns and you did not define any in your migration(s), you will run into problems.

It is important that the `Model` base class constructor runs. It is not required to define a constructor for user-defined models.

Finally, unlike some other frameworks, the table targeted by your model will not be inferred from the name of your model. You must specify the name of the table your model targets in the `table` class attribute within your user-defined model. 

### `connection`

This attribute is set by default in the `Model` base class to the currently configured database connection. You can override it and redefine it to another database connection in any individual user-defined model. Otherwise, don't bother defining the attribute in your user-defined model.

```python
from ..helpers.model import Model

class PurchaseHistoryItem(Model):
  connection = 'analysis.db'
  table = 'purchase_history_item'
```

### `softDeletes`

By default this is set to `False` in the `Model` parent class. If you set it to true in your derived model class, you must make sure the targeted table has a nullable column of the `Real` type called `deleted_at`. Enabling soft deletion functionality allows you to use a number of methods discussed below to include or exclude "trashed" records. When a model is soft deleted, instead of being removed from the database, a timestamp is stored in its `deleted_at` column. 

### `timestamps`

By default, this is set to `True` in the `Model` base class. You can turn it off by setting it to `False` in your derived class. When it is turned on, records will be timestamped when they are created and whenever they are updated via the Model system. 

### `is` and `isNot`

Pass in another model to either of these methods to determine if the models are the same model or not (comparing primary key, table, and database connection).

### `getOriginal`

Even if you have mutated your model since it was hydrated from or pushed to the database, this method will return its original attributes.

### `isDirty`

Tells you if you've altered the model at all from the values that are returned by the `getOriginal` method.

### `isClean`

Returns the opposite boolean value of whatever is returned by `isDirty`.

### `hydrated`

Tells you if all attributes that are not `nullable` have been filled.

### `trashed`

Returns a boolean indicating whether a model has been soft deleted or not.

### `withTrashed`

Chainable method for queries to indicate the result set of models should include soft deleted records.

### `onlyTrashed`

Chainable method for queries indicating the result set of models should only invlude soft deleted models.

### `allModels`

Get all models from a table. Can be used in conjunction with a `limit`. By default does not include soft deleted models.

### `fresh`

Hit the database again and re-hydrate model with fresh data.

### `refresh`

The same as the `fresh` method but all currently loaded relationships will be re-hydrated as well.

### `find`

Pass in an `id` of a model you want. By default does not consider soft deleted models. Returns `None` if none is found.

### `save`

To persist a new model, call this method after setting required attributes on a freshly instantiated model. Also call this method after altering a model's attributes to update the record in the database.

### `limit`

Chainable method that works like the query builder's `limit` method.

### `orderBy`

Pass in an attribute/column and optionally 'asc' (the default) or 'dsc' to sort result set of models accordingly.

### `condition`

Like the method of the same name on the query builder.

### `conditions`

Like the method of the same name on the query builder.

### `get`

Like the method of the same name on the query builder.

### `chunk`

Like the method of the same name on the query builder.

### `chunkById`

Like the method of the same name on the query builder.

### `delete`

If soft deletes are enabled, will soft delete the model. Otherwise, this method will really delete the model. 

### `forceDelete`

Even if soft deletes are enabled, this will really delete the model.

### `destroy`

Pass in an `id` to target for deletion. Exactly like `delete` except model is not loadedbefore record is deleted (or soft deleted) in database.

### `restore`

Remove soft deleted status from current model.

### Defining `relations` 

If you wish to define relations for a user-defined model, you will define them in a dictionary on the class attribute `relations` within your user-defined model. The keys of the dictionary will be names that you will use to refer to the relations when loading them. 

If you want any of the relations to be eager loaded automatically whenever a model is hydrated, define a `defaultRelations` class attribute with a list containing the names of all such relations. Note that these relations will be automatically loaded when your model is hydrated as a result of a query, but tertiary and n-ary models will not be automatically loaded as a result of this `defaultRelations` definition. This is to prevent accidentally loading an entire database into memory. 

#### `hasOne`

Look at the following example:

```python
from tenant import Tenant
from ..helpers.model import Model

class Apartment(Model):
  table = 'apartment'
  relations = {
    'tenant': {
      'type': 'hasOne',
      'model': Tenant
    }
  }
  defaultRelations = ('tenant',)
```

It will be assumed that the table at the connection defined for the `Tenant` model will have a foreign key column named after the `Apartment` model's table name plus `_id` concatenated (i.e. `apartment_id`). If you name the foreign key column something else, define its name as follows:

```python
from tenant import Tenant
from ..helpers.model import Model

class Apartment(Model):
  table = 'apartment'
  relations = {
    'tenant': {
      'type': 'hasOne',
      'model': Tenant,
      'foreign': 'unit_number'
    }
  }
  defaultRelations = ('tenant',)
```
This type of relation allows you to define a `default` dictionary of key-value pairs to use in the event that result of the relationship query is `null`.

```python
from tenant import Tenant
from ..helpers.model import Model

class Apartment(Model):
  table = 'tenant'
  relations = {
    'tenant': {
      'type': 'hasOne',
      'model': Tenant,
      'default': {
        'id': 0,
        'name': 'Vacant (No Tenant)',
        'ssn': 0
      }
    }
  }
  defaultRelations = ('tenant',)
```

#### `hasMany`

Define this type of relation in exactly the same fashion as the `hasOne` relationship, except with the `hasMany` keyword.


```python
from apartment import Apartment
from parking_space import ParkingSpace
from ..helpers.model import Model

class User(Model):
  table = 'user'
  relations = {
    'apartment': {
      'type': 'hasOne',
      'model': Apartment,
    },
    'parkingSpace': {
      'type': 'hasMany',
      'model': ParkingSpace
    }
  }
  defaultRelations = ('apartment', 'parkingSpace')
```

#### `belongsTo`

This type of relation is the inverse of both the `hasOne` and `hasMany` types. Note that if you define a 'foreign' attribute it refers to the foreign key column name in the table referenced by the model that the relation is defined on (i.e. in the following example, the `id_of_tenant` column in the `parking_space` table). Also, if you wish an update to or deletion of this child model to update the timestamp of the parent model, add a `touch` class attribute to the child model with a list containing the names of the relationships to which that rule applies. This "touching" will not occur if a database record is deleted without a corresponding model being hydrated.

```python
from tenant import Tenant 
from ..helpers.model import Model 

class ParkingSpace(Model):
  table = 'parking_space'
  touch = ('tenant',)
  relations = {
    'tenant': {
      'type': 'belongsTo',
      'model': Tenant,
      'foreign': 'id_of_tenant'
    }
  }
```

Like the `hasOne` relationship, you can define a `default` dictionary of key-value pairs to use in lieu of a real database record when the relation turns up `null`.

```python
from tenant import Tenant 
from ..helpers.model import Model 

class ParkingSpace(Model):
  table = 'parking_space'
  touch = ('tenant',)
  relations = {
    'tenant': {
      'type': 'belongsTo',
      'model': Tenant,
      'default': {
        'id': '0',
        'description': 'Guest Parking Space'
      }
    }
  }
```

#### `belongsToMany`

This type is used in defining both sides of a many-to-many relationship. Also, like the `belongsTo` relationship type, you can define a `touch` attribute on the class to indicate you want the related model to have its timestamp updated when this model is updated. With this type of relationship, the timestamp touching rule can go one way or both ways (or neither at all of course if you don't define it in either model).

```python
from course import Course
from ..helpers.model import Model
from schedule import Schedule

class Student(Model):
  table = 'student'
  relations = {
    'Courses': {
      'type': 'belongsToMany',
      'model': Course,
      'pivot': Schedule
    }
  }
```

```python
from student import Student 
from..helpers.model import Model 
from schedule import Schedule

class Course(Model):
  table = 'course'
  touch = ('students',)
  relations = {
    'students': {
      'type': 'belongsToMany',
      'model': Student,
      'pivot': Schedule
    }
  }
```

In the `Courses` relationship below, the `foreign` key is the column name in the pivot table (whose model in this case is `Schedule`) that contains `id`s of records in the `course` table. The `local` key refers to the column in the pivot table that contains `id`s of records in the `student` table.

```python
from course import Course
from schedule import Schedule
from ..helpers.model import Model

class Student(Model):
  table = 'student'
  relations = {
    'Courses': {
      'type': 'belongsToMany',
      'model': Course,
      'foreign': 'id_of_course',
      'local': 'id_of_student',
      'pivot': Schedule
    }
  }
```

```python
from student import Student 
from schedule import Schedule
from ..helpers.model import Model 

class Course(Model):
  table = 'course'
  touch = ('students',)
  relations = {
    'students': {
      'type': 'belongsToMany',
      'model': Student,
      'foreign': 'id_of_student',
      'local': 'id_of_course',
      'pivot': Schedule
    }
  }
```

Pivot tables will not be inferred. You must explicitly define their existence with a user-defined model that extends the `Model` class. There is no special `Pivot` class. You must explicitly define the pivot table name in that model. Customizing the connection is optional. Pivot tables should not use composite primary keys, but an incrementing primary key column named `id`. By default timestamps are turned on for pivot models just like all other models, so turn them off if you need to do so. In the event that you want to use timestamps for your pivot model, the `updated_at` timestamp in most cases won't ever be updated except when one of the models in the many-to-many relationship has a `touch` event that affects the timestamp in the other model. In that case, the timestamp in the pivot table will be updated as well.

```python
from student import Student 
from course import Course 
from ..helpers.model import Model 

class Schedule(Model):
  table = 'schedule' 
  connection = 'pivots.db'
  timestamps = True
```

#### `morphOne` and `morphTo`

At this point I'm pretty transparently ripping off Laravel's naming conventions for polymorphic model relationships. However, they make a lot of sense, and this is just a learning project for me. 

A polymorphic one-to-one relationship is a lot like the normal one-to-one relationships defined by `hasOne` and `belongsTo` as discussed above. However, the model in the relationship that defines the `belongsTo` aspect of the relationship in this case may belong to two or more types of other models. This works because, in addition to the foreign key field, this model's table has another column that stores the type of model that foreign key belongs to in string format.

The `morphOne` part of the relationship is the polymorphic equivalent of `hasOne`. The `morphTo` relationship is defined on the tricky model that can belong to multiple types of other models.

In the case of a model defining one or more `morphTo` relations, you must also define a class member variable called `owners`. It should contain a dictionary whose keys are all the different strings found in its `able_type` column and whose values are the corresponding model classes.

```python
from ..helpers.model import Model
from comment import Comment

class Post(Model):
  table = 'post'
  relations = {
    'comment': {
      'type': 'morphOne',
      'model': Comment
    }
  }
```
```python
from ..helpers.model import Model
from comment import Comment

class Video(Model):
  table = 'video'
  relations = {
    'comment': {
      'type': 'morphOne',
      'model': Comment
    }
  }
```
```python
from ..helpers.model import Model
from post import Post 
from video import Video 

class Comment(Model):
  table = 'comment'
  touch = ('commentable',)
  owners = {
    'post': Post,
    'video': Video 
  }
  relations = {
    'commentable': {
      'type': 'morphTo'
    }
  }
```

In this case, the `comment` table will have a foreign key column named `commentable_id` and another column called `commentable_type`. The names of these columns are non-negotiable and derived from concatenating `able_id` and `able_type` onto the end of the table name. You don't need to name the relation `commentable`, but I like that convention. Note that like `belongsTo` relations, you can specify that you wish an update to this model to propagate an update to the timestamp of the related model. Also, like the ordinary `hasOne` and `belongsTo` 
relation types, you can define a `default` dictionary of key-value pairs, for both `morphTo` and `morphOne` relations, to return if the relationship query turns up `null`.

#### `morphMany` 

This is for defining one-to-many polymorphic relationships. Defining one-to-many polymorphic relationships works exactly like defining one-to-one relationships, but `morphMany` will take the place of `morphOne`.

#### `morphToMany` and `morphedByMany`

Many-to-many polymorphic relationships are for cool people only. Imagine that an application supports `Hashtag`s. There are many `Hashtag`s, and each one can also be associated with many `Post`s. Additionally, each `Post` can support multiple `Hashtag`s. The complicating factor for this application is that `Comment`s can also have multiple `Hashtag`s. 

For this you will need to define four models: `Post`, `Comment`, `Hashtag`, `Hashtagable`. 

```python
from ..helpers.model import Model
from hashtag import Hashtag 
from hashtagable import Hashtagable 

class Post(Model):
  table = 'post'
  relations = {
    'hashtags': {
      'type': 'morphedByMany',
      'model': Hashtag,
      'pivot': Hashtagable
    }
  }
```

```python
from ..helpers.model import Model
from hashtag import Hashtag 
from hashtagable import Hashtagable 

class Comment(Model):
  table = 'commentcomment'
  relations = {
    'hashtags': {
      'type': 'morphedByMany',
      'model': Hashtag,
      'pivot': Hashtagable
    }
  }
```

```python
from ..helpers.model import model
from hashtagable import Hashtagable

class Hashtag(Model):
  table = 'hashtag'
  touch = ('hashtagables',)
  relations = {
    'hashtagables': {
      'type': 'morphToMany',
      'pivot': Hashtagable
    }
  }
```

```python
from ..helpers import Model
from hashtag import Hashtag

class Hashtagable(Model):
  table = 'hashtagable'
  relations = {
    'hashtag': {
      'type': 'poly',
      'model': Hashtag
    }
  }
```

It will be assumed, no matter what you named your pivot class, that it contains an `id` column, a column named after the table plus `_id` concatenated (i.e. `hashtagable_id`), a column named after the table plus `_type` concatenated (i.e. `hashtagable_type`), and a column named after the table of the model defining the `morphToMany` relationship with `_id` concatenated (i.e. `hashtag_id`).

### Loading `relations`

There are multiple ways to hydrate related models.

#### `defaultRelations`, `withRelations`, and `without`

List the names of the `relations` you want to load automatically when a model is hydrated in the `defaultRelations` class attribute.

If you wish to skip one or more of those specified relations when building a query, use the `without` method by passing into it a list or tuple of relation names. The `withRelations` method conversely allows you to ensure the loading of related models not specified in the `defaultRelations` list.

```python
from ..helpers.model import Model 
from author import Author 
from comment import Comment

class Article(Model):
  table = 'article'
  relations = {
    'author': {
      'type': 'belongsTo',
      'model': Author
    },
    'comments': {
      'type': 'hasMany',
      'model': Comment 
    }
  }
  defaultRelations = ('author',)
  
articles = Article().withRelations(('comments',)).without(('author',)).allModels()
# articles is a List of hydrated Article models, none of which have their author loaded and all of which have their comment relations loaded.
```

Note that this rule will not apply when a model is hydrated as a result of one of the operations in the following sections. For example, if you use the `load` function to load a `Post`'s `comments`, your `Comment` models will not automatically load their `Author` relations even if they are configured to do so automatically.

#### `load`

If after a model is hydrated without  certain `relations` loaded, because of one of the mechanisms just discussed, you want to load one, pass in a list or tuple of the one(s) you want to the `load` function.

#### `withCount`, `withSum`, `withMin`, `withMax`, `withAvg`

The same mechanism as the `withRelations` method. All except `withCount` require a second parameter in the form of a column name. Will place the calculated scalar value as an attribute on the model (e.g. `comments_count`, `comments_score_avg`, etc).

#### `loadCount`, `loadSum`, `loadAvg`, `loadMin`, `loadMax`

Same as last section but with `load` function mechanism.
