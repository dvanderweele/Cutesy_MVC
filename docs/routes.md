In the `routes.py` file you can easily define the routes that requests generated by the View/UI layer of your application (see `client.md`) may take to your user-defined controller methods. 

Define a tuple called `definitions`. It should contain only tuples, each one of length two and representing a route within your application. 

The first member of a route tuple should have the string or other unique value you use to identify a route when specifying it in a request object. The second member should be a reference to the controller method you want that route to call. 

For example: 

```python
# routes.py
from .controllers.UserController import UserController 
from .controllers.CommentController import CommentController 

definitions = (
	('/users/list', UserController.index),
	('/users/show', UserController.show),
	('/comments/list', CommentController.index)
)
```
